# Basic-HTML-Website
## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to teach you how to structure a website using HTML, including different sections such as header, footer, navigation, main content, and sidebars. Styling the website is not required; focus only on the structure. Styling will be done in separate projects.

## Project Requirements

Create a simple HTML-only website with multiple pages. The website should include the following pages:

- Homepage
- Projects
- Articles
- Contact

### Navigation Bar

The website must have a navigation bar that is present on all pages and links to each of the pages listed above.

### Goals

1. Learn how to create multiple pages in a website.
2. Structure a website using HTML in a semantic way.
3. Ensure the structure allows for easy styling later.
4. Add SEO meta tags to each page of the website.

### Mockup Example

Use the following mockup example to create the website's structure. Remember, you are not required to style the website; focus on the structure that can be styled later:
